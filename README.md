# Associated data and code

The files in this code repository are commented versions of the code used for the following work:

_A Numerical Framework for the Parameter Identification of the SIRD Model_ by Andr√©s Miniguano-Trujillo, John Pearson, Ben Goddard.

## Main files in this repository

* [`ReadMe.md`](ReadMe.md): This file.
* The [`Outputs`](Outputs) subfolder contains all the plots generated by each test alongside a summary of each optimisation step.

Jupyter notebooks with code for three sets of tests are included. 

1. First, an exact test where the target is generated from solving the SIR model and the parameter identification problem aims to reconstruct the parameters used to build the target. The relevant notebooks are [`[Exact] GD.ipynb`](%5BExact%5D%20GD.ipynb), [`[Exact] FISTA.ipynb`](%5BExact%5D%20FISTA.ipynb), and [`[Exact] LM-BFGS.ipynb`](%5BExact%5D%20LM-BFGS.ipynb).
2. Second, a smooth target is generated and fitted using a regularised optimisation problem. The effects of the regularisation parameter are showcased with several tests. The relevant notebooks are [`[Regularisation] GD`](%5BRegularisation%5D%20GD.ipynb), [`[Regularisation] FISTA`](%5BRegularisation%5D%20FISTA.ipynb), and [`[Regularisation] LM-BFGS`](%5BRegularisation%5D%20LM-BFGS.ipynb).
3. Third, robustness of the numerical approach is tested by sampling the target from a known smooth transformation of a solution from the SIRD model and fitted using a regularised problem with terminal costs. The effects of the resolution (i.e., number of sampling points) are showcased. The relevant notebooks are [`[Grid] GD`](%5BGrid%5D%20GD.ipynb), [`[Grid] FISTA`](%5BGrid%5D%20FISTA.ipynb), and [`[Grid] LM-BFGS`](%5BGrid%5D%20LM-BFGS.ipynb).

For better visualisation of the notebooks, the `codefolding` for Jupyter [extension](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is recommended.
